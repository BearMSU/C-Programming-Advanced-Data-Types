# C-Programming-Advanced-Data-Types

These are assignments coded during my edX course for C Programming: Advanced Data Types

These are by no means the only way to solve these activities, but are my solutions to them.
I'll add comments in places to denote exactly what/why I've done certain things in the code.

Thank you!
